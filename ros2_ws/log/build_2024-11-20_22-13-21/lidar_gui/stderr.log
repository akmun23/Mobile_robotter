[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgmapping.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gmapping",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gmapping" with any
  of the following names:

    gmappingConfig.cmake
    gmapping-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gmapping" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gmapping_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gmapping" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
